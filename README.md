## Development server

Run `npm start` or `ng serve` to run the app locally. Then navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`.

## Overview
<a href="https://coverup.studio">Coverup</a> – a web application designed for music enthusiasts and creators. This app seamlessly blends simplicity with functionality, enabling users to add custom cover images to their MP3 files directly within the browser, with no server uploads necessary. Also, it has a user-friendly interface and rapid processing, all while ensuring your files remain entirely within your control.

## Features
- Local Processing: Experience the speed and security of local file handling. Your MP3s and images never leave your device, ensuring complete privacy and swift operations.
- File Support: mp3, jpg, jpeg, png.
- Intuitive UI: A sleek and responsive design powered by Angular and SCSS, offering a seamless user experience across various devices.
- Progressive Web App (PWA): Install <a href="https://coverup.studio">Coverup</a> on your device for an app-like experience, enhanced performance, and ease of access.
- Offline Capabilities: Thanks to PWA technology, <a href="https://coverup.studio">Coverup</a> is cached and fully operational offline, making it perfect for on-the-go usage without internet access.

## How It Works
<a href="https://coverup.studio">Coverup</a> uses web technologies to process files locally on your browser. Once you upload an MP3 file and its corresponding cover image, the app quickly embeds the image into the MP3's metadata. This process is entirely local – your files do not get uploaded to any server, ensuring maximum security and speed.
